Complexity (Fixing poing is the baseline) - The game is much more complex then pong.

Overall look & feel	- The game looks quite good and is fun to play. 

Effectiveness of personal twist.	-    Not much of a personal twist as the game is not any classic arcade game but a complete different game, the only twist is that player can control arrow even after shooting
